        evolve(generations: int, selection_pressure: float = 0.5) -> EvolutionResult
        
        Evolves the organism over multiple generations.
        
        Parameters:
            generations (int): Number of generations to evolve (must be positive)
            selection_pressure (float): Controls evolutionary selection intensity (0.0-1.0)
                - 0.0: Random selection (no pressure)
                - 0.5: Balanced selection (default)
                - 1.0: Only fittest survive (maximum pressure)
        
        Returns:
            EvolutionResult: Contains fitness history and evolved genome
        
        Raises:
            ValueError: If generations < 0 or selection_pressure not in [0, 1]
        
        Example:
            >>> organism = DigitalOrganism()
            >>> result = organism.evolve(generations=100, selection_pressure=0.7)
            >>> print(result.final_fitness)
        ```
