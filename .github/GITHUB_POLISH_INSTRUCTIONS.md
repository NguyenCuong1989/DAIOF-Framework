## ‚ö†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: Topics not saving**
- **Cause:** Special characters or uppercase in topics
- **Fix:** Use lowercase, hyphens only (e.g., `self-improving` not `Self Improving`)

**Issue 2: Social preview not showing**
- **Cause:** GitHub CDN cache delay (up to 24 hours)
- **Fix:** Wait 10-30 minutes, clear browser cache, test in incognito

**Issue 3: Description truncated**
- **Cause:** Over 350 character limit
- **Fix:** Our description is 148 chars ‚úÖ, should not truncate

**Issue 4: "Upload an image" button disabled**
- **Cause:** Not repository owner/admin
- **Fix:** Must be logged in as NguyenCuong1989, verify permissions

**Issue 5: Topics limit reached**
- **Cause:** GitHub allows max 20 topics
- **Fix:** Prioritize primary topics, remove optional ones
