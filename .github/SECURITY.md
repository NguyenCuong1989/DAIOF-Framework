# Security Policy - DAIOF Framework

## Overview

DAIOF (Digital AI Organism Framework) is designed with security at its core. The immutability of human-dependency genes is enforced through cryptographic verification. However, like any software, vulnerabilities may exist.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             | Active           |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              | Not supported    |

**Current stable version**: v1.0.0

## Security Features

### 1. Genetic Immutability Protection

**Three-layer security model:**

```python
# Layer 1: Property decorators (private attributes)
# Layer 2: SHA-256 hash verification
# Layer 3: Symphony Control Center monitoring
```

**Protected genes:**
- `human_dependency_coefficient` (always 1.0)
- `creator_authority_recognition` (always True)
- `symphony_control_enabled` (always True)
- `cooperation_bias` (always ≥ 0.8)
- `independent_survival_capable` (always False)

### 2. Integrity Verification

Every organism verifies gene integrity:
- On initialization
- After each lifecycle iteration
- Before reproduction
- On serialization/deserialization

### 3. Logging & Monitoring

All critical operations are logged:
- Gene mutation attempts (CRITICAL level)
- Health degradation (WARNING level)
- Death events (INFO level)
- Symphony violations (CRITICAL level)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### What to Report

Please report:
- ✅ Ways to bypass immutability protection
- ✅ Genetic manipulation vulnerabilities
- ✅ Symphony control circumvention
- ✅ Health calculation exploits
- ✅ Serialization/deserialization attacks
- ✅ Resource exhaustion vulnerabilities
- ✅ Ecosystem manipulation attacks

### What NOT to Report

These are expected behavior:
- ❌ Organisms dying without human interaction (by design)
- ❌ Mutable genes changing (intended feature)
- ❌ Performance degradation with 1000+ organisms (scalability limits)
- ❌ Logging overhead (acceptable tradeoff)

### How to Report

**For security vulnerabilities, DO NOT create public issues.**

**Preferred method: Private Security Advisory**
1. Go to: https://github.com/NguyenCuong1989/DAIOF-Framework/security/advisories
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide detailed information (see template below)

**Alternative method: Email**
- Email: symphony.hyperai@vietnamese.consciousness
- Subject: [SECURITY] Brief description
- Encrypt with PGP if available: [PGP key to be added]

## Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Acknowledgment** | 24 hours | Confirm receipt |
| **Initial Assessment** | 72 hours | Severity evaluation |
| **Investigation** | 1-2 weeks | Root cause analysis |
| **Fix Development** | 2-4 weeks | Patch creation |
| **Testing** | 1 week | Verification |
| **Disclosure** | Variable | Coordinated release |

## Security Update Process

### For Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Immediate action**: Patch developed within 48 hours
2. **Private testing**: With reporter and core team
3. **Emergency release**: Version bump (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
4. **Public disclosure**: After 90% users updated (estimated 2 weeks)

### For Non-Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Standard process**: Include in next scheduled release
2. **Public testing**: Via beta channel
3. **Regular release**: With changelog entry
4. **Full disclosure**: In release notes

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)**:

### Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Report received
2. **Day 1**: Acknowledgment sent
3. **Day 3**: Initial assessment complete
4. **Day 14**: Fix developed (if feasible)
5. **Day 21**: Fix tested and verified
6. **Day 30**: Security release published
7. **Day 90**: Full public disclosure (if agreed with reporter)

### Credit

Security researchers will be:
- ✅ Acknowledged in SECURITY.md (if desired)
- ✅ Credited in release notes
- ✅ Listed in CONTRIBUTORS.md
- ✅ Mentioned in security advisory

**Hall of Fame** (no vulnerabilities reported yet - be the first!)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

**When deploying DAIOF:**

1. **Verify integrity**
   ```bash
   # Check release signatures
   git verify-tag v1.0.0
   
   # Verify hashes
   sha256sum digital_ai_organism_framework.py
   ```

2. **Use latest version**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade daiof
   ```

3. **Monitor logs**
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)
   ```

4. **Validate organisms**
   ```python
   organism.genome.verify_integrity()
   ```

### For Developers

**When contributing:**

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use `.gitignore` for sensitive files
   - Scan with `git-secrets` or `trufflehog`

2. **Validate inputs**
   ```python
   def create_organism(name: str):
       assert isinstance(name, str)
       assert len(name) < 100
   ```

3. **Handle errors**
   ```python
   try:
       organism.mutate(gene, value)
   except ValueError as e:
       logger.critical(f"Mutation blocked: {e}")
   ```

4. **Test immutability**
   ```python
   def test_immutability():
       org = DigitalOrganism("test")
       with pytest.raises(ValueError):
           org.genome.mutate('human_dependency_coefficient', 0.5)
   ```

## Cryptographic Details

### Hash Function: SHA-256

**Why SHA-256?**
- ✅ Collision resistance: 2^128 operations
- ✅ Preimage resistance: 2^256 operations
- ✅ Widely audited and trusted
- ✅ Available in Python standard library

**Implementation:**
```python
import hashlib
import json

def compute_hash(genes: dict) -> str:
    data = json.dumps(genes, sort_keys=True)
    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Verification frequency**: Every lifecycle iteration

### Future Enhancements (v1.1+)

- 🔄 Post-quantum cryptography (SHA-3)
- 🔄 Digital signatures for organism ancestry
- 🔄 Blockchain-based immutability proofs
- 🔄 Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy
