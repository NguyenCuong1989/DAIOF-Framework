### Day 4: Nov 3 (Sunday) - Launch Prep
**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] 📝 Write launch posts

  **Reddit r/opensource**:
  ```markdown
  Title: I built a self-improving GitHub organism that codes autonomously 24/7
  
  [Include demo GIF]
  
  After months of work, I'm excited to share DAIOF Framework - a "digital organism" that lives on GitHub and autonomously improves itself.
  
  What it does:
  - Scans repository every 10 seconds
  - Generates improvement tasks automatically
  - Commits code, fixes formatting, updates docs
  - Monitors its own health (currently 100/100)
  - Never stops improving
  
  Tech: Python, GitHub Actions, PyYAML, Black
  
  It's been running for [X days] and has made [X] autonomous commits.
  
  Repo: github.com/NguyenCuong1989/DAIOF-Framework
  
  Would love feedback from the community!
  ```

  **Hacker News**:
  ```
  Title: Show HN: DAIOF – Self-improving digital organism on GitHub
  
  Link: github.com/NguyenCuong1989/DAIOF-Framework
  
  Text:
  I built an autonomous system that lives on GitHub and continuously improves itself. Every 10 seconds it scans the repository, generates tasks (fix formatting, update docs, commit changes), and executes them.
  
  It's inspired by the idea of treating code infrastructure as a living organism with self-healing and adaptive capabilities.
  
  Currently running with 100/100 health score, 7 autonomous workflows, and real-time task generation.
  
  Tech stack: Python 3.8+, GitHub Actions, PyYAML
  
  Happy to answer questions!
  ```
