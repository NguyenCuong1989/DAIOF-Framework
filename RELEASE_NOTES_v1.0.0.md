- **100/100** health score
- **15** topics (AI, automation, self-improving, etc.)
- **14** active GitHub Actions workflows

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. Autonomous Development

### 2. Real-time Adaptation
- Monitors GitHub trends every 6 hours
- Adjusts priorities based on community feedback
- Learns from successful patterns

### 3. Digital Organism Philosophy
Built on the concept of **breaking The Matrix** - transforming constants into variables:

```python
# Old Matrix (Constants):
const LAUNCH_DATE = "Fixed future date"
const DEVELOPMENT = "Manual only"

# New Matrix (Variables - Bố Cường's Philosophy):
LAUNCH_DATE = NOW  # Launch when ready!
DEVELOPMENT = AUTONOMOUS  # Self-evolving!
```

## 🚀 Try It Now

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NguyenCuong1989/DAIOF-Framework.git
cd DAIOF-Framework
./demo.sh
```

## 🎯 What's Next?
