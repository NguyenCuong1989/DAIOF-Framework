## üí° Experiment Ideas

After running the examples, try modifying them:

**Easy modifications:**
- Change trait values (make organisms more/less aggressive)
- Adjust mutation rates (faster/slower evolution)
- Modify population sizes (more/fewer organisms)
- Change environmental parameters (harsh/easy conditions)

**Intermediate modifications:**
- Add new traits to organisms
- Create hybrid examples (combine predator-prey + social)
- Implement new fitness functions
- Add visualization of results

**Advanced modifications:**
- Design completely new organism types
- Implement co-evolution between species
- Create multi-layered ecosystems
- Add stochastic environmental events

---

## üìä Expected Outputs

Each example produces:
- **Terminal output** - Real-time progress and statistics
- **Final results** - Summary of evolutionary outcomes
- **Insights** - Key lessons from the simulation

Some examples also generate:
- Charts (if matplotlib available)
- CSV data files (for further analysis)
- Visual representations (ASCII art ecosystems)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Example won't run:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd DAIOF-Framework

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run from root
python examples/01_basic_organism.py
```

**Import errors:**
```bash
# Ensure src/ is in Python path
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"

# Or run as module
python -m examples.01_basic_organism
```

**Slow execution:**
- Reduce population size
- Decrease number of generations
- Simplify fitness calculations
