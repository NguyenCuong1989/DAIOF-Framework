## Title

```
Show HN: A GitHub repository that maintains itself autonomously (self-evolving code)
```

*Character count: 83 (optimal for HN, under 80 ideal but this is descriptive)*

**Alternative titles (pick best):**
1. `Show HN: Self-maintaining GitHub repo – autonomous agent running 24/7`
2. `Show HN: DAIOF – Framework for building self-evolving code organisms`
3. `Show HN: Repository that commits code to itself every 10 seconds (autonomous)`

## First Comment (Post Immediately After Submission)

```markdown
Hi HN! I built a GitHub repository that operates autonomously - it analyzes its own state every 10 seconds, generates improvement tasks, and commits code changes without human intervention.

**What it does:**

• Task generation: Every 10s, scans repo state, identifies issues (formatting, optimization, documentation gaps)
• Autonomous commits: Auto-formats code, updates metrics, fixes syntax errors
• PR management: Reviews incoming PRs, runs safety checks, auto-merges if tests pass
• Health monitoring: Scores itself 0-100 every 12 hours, logs to dashboard
• Dependency updates: Weekly scans, creates PRs with full changelogs

Current stats: 100/100 health, 38 autonomous commits in 7 days, 13 active workflows.

**Technical approach:**

The core is `.github/scripts/realtime_task_generator.py` - a simple agent that:

1. Reads repository state (git status, metrics, workflow runs)
2. Scores urgency of potential tasks (1-10 priority)
3. Executes highest-priority task if > 8
4. Commits result with detailed metadata

Triggered via GitHub Actions every 10 seconds (workflow_dispatch + cron).

**Why build this?**

I'm researching "digital organisms" - treating code like biological systems. The repo is proof-of-concept for a larger framework (DAIOF) that applies genetic algorithms and evolutionary principles to AI systems.

The idea: what if codebases could evolve like organisms? Mutation (random changes), selection (metrics-driven), reproduction (forking with variation).

**Safety concerns addressed:**

• All major changes require approval gate (human in loop)
• Health monitoring with automatic rollback on score drop
• Every action logged and auditable
• Rate limits on auto-commits (max 1 per 10s)
• Can disable autonomous mode via environment variable

**Demo:**

Run `./demo.sh` in the repo to see it in action. Shows real-time task generation, health scoring, and autonomous decision-making.

**Open questions for HN:**

1. Is there value in self-maintaining repos beyond novelty? (I think yes for large projects)
2. How would you handle security of autonomous code changes? (current: strict PR review even for bot)
3. What systems would benefit from "organism-like" behavior? (I'm thinking databases, infrastructure)

MIT licensed. Happy to dive into technical details!

## HN-Specific Strategy

### What HN Readers Care About:

1. **Technical depth** - They want to see the code, not just marketing
2. **Novel approach** - "Self-maintaining repo" is unusual enough to get attention
3. **Working demo** - `./demo.sh` provides immediate proof
4. **Open questions** - HN loves debating design decisions
5. **Security concerns** - Address proactively (they'll ask anyway)

### Expected Comments:

**Positive:**
- "This is actually clever - imagine scaling to monorepos"
- "The organism metaphor is interesting from a research perspective"
- "I could use this for my side project"

**Skeptical:**
- "Isn't this just cron + scripts?"
  - *Reply: No, it makes decisions based on state, not just schedules*
- "What stops it from pushing malicious code?"
  - *Reply: Approval gates + health monitoring + full audit trail*
- "Seems like overengineering for simple automation"
  - *Reply: Yes for small projects, but think 10K+ file repos*

**Technical:**
- "How do you handle GitHub Actions minutes limits?"
  - *Reply: ~1 minute per run, 2000 free/month = viable for personal repos*
- "Show me the task prioritization algorithm"
  - *Reply: Link to realtime_task_generator.py lines 45-89*
- "Can this work with other Git providers?"
  - *Reply: Currently GH-specific, but core framework is platform-agnostic*

### Engagement Plan:

**First 2 hours (critical):**
- Reply to EVERY comment within 15 minutes
- Provide code links for technical questions
- Add "Edit:" to first comment with answers to recurring questions

**First 24 hours:**
- Monitor position on front page (goal: stay in top 30)
- Post metrics update: "12 hours later: +X GitHub stars, Y forks"
- Engage with criticism constructively (HN values intellectual honesty)

**First week:**
- Write follow-up post if traction high: "Show HN: Results from self-evolving repo (1 week)"
- Cross-link to research paper outline if requested

## If Post Gets Traction

**Update first comment after 2 hours with:**
```
Edit (2 hours later): Thanks for the great questions! Quick updates:

• Added FAQ to README based on your feedback
• 15 GitHub stars in first 2 hours (thanks HN!)
• Fixed workflow rate limit issue mentioned by @username
• Demo video: [link] for those who want to see it running

Keep the questions coming - this is exactly the feedback I need.
```

**If it reaches front page top 10:**
- Prepare for 50-100+ comments
- Block out 3-4 hours to engage
- Keep replies concise (HN readers skim)
- Link to code, not blog posts

**If it doesn't get traction:**
- Wait 24 hours
- Repost with different title (allowed on HN if < 5 upvotes)
- Try alternative title #2 from above
- Post at different time (Tuesday 9 AM)
